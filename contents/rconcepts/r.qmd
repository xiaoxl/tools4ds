# R Setup

## RStudio

For R, the almost definite choice of IDE is RStudio. You may download and install it from [the homepage](https://posit.co/downloads/). The installation and beginning usage is straightforward. RStudio is using the default R console. 

Although the best R IDE is RStudio, there are still some people willing to try other options. In the rest part of this section I will briefly describe how to set up R environment using other IDES/platforms. 

## `radian`
`radian` is an alternative console for the R program with multiline editing and rich syntax highlight. One would consider `radian` as a `IPython` clone for R, though its design is more aligned to [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

`radian` is a R console. So to install it you should have an installation of R (version 3.4.0 or above). `radian` is mainly written in Python. Therefore to install it you should have an installation of Python (version 3.6 or above). Then you may use the following command to install `radian`.

```{.bash}
conda install -c conda-forge radian
```
or 

```{.bash}
pip install -U radian
```


### Use the console
First find the path to the console. If you use `conda` to install `radian`, the path is `<anaconda path>/Scripts/radian.exe`. When you directly run the executable file `radian.exe`, the console will be activated. You may start to run R code.

You may use `q()` to exit `radian`.

## VS Code Configuration
The main reference is [the official document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r).


If you would like to use VS Code as your main IDE for R, it is usually recommended to install the following components.

1. R extension for VS Code by REditorSupport. You may get it through [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r), or search for it within VS Code.
2. Install `languageserver` in R.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("languageserver")
```

3. `radian`. This is an alternative R console introduced above. Note that to use `radian` in VS Code you need to set the `rterm` variable in VS Code setting to be the path of your `radian` installation.
4. `httpgd`. This is a R package which is for better plotting in VS Code. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("httpgd")
```

Running R code is simply sending code to the R terminal. Before running R code, you could create an R terminal via command `R: Create R terminal` in the Command Palette. If you set `radian` path, this R terminal will be `radian`.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
You may adding the following Keyboard Shortcuts to VS Code. These are the same setting used in RStudio which are commonly used. The first two are using `alt+-` to produce `<-` and the latter two are using `ctrl+shift+m` to produce `%>%`.

```{.json}
{
"key": "alt+-",
"command": "type",
"when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId =~ /r|rmd|qmd/",
"args": {"text": " <- "}
},
{
"key": "alt+-",
"command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
"when": "terminalFocus",
"args": {"text": " <- "}
},
{
"key": "ctrl+shift+m",
"command": "type",
"when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId =~ /r|rmd|quarto/",
"args": {"text": " %>% "}
},
{
"key": "ctrl+shift+m",
"command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
"when": "terminalFocus",
"args": {"text": " %>% "}
},
```

## Cloud IDE options
There are tons of online IDEs that supports R. The following two are the biggest names.

### Posit Cloud (formally RStudio Cloud)
You may directly go to the [homepage](https://posit.cloud/) to use RStudio from cloud. If you don't use it a lot it should be free.

### Google Colab
You may use R in Google Colab. Note that by default R is disabled. You have to use a specific version of Google Colab through [colab.to/r](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r). After you get into the system, you may go to `Edit->Notebook settings` to change Runtime type to be `R`.

The rest is similar to Jupyter notebook, while the codes are now R codes.
